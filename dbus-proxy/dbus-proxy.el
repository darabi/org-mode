;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Here is a basic example of the intended use:
;;
;; (let ((epiphany (dbus-proxy-make-remote-proxy
;;		    :session
;;		    "org.gnome.Epiphany"
;;		    "/org/gnome/Epiphany")))
;;   (open-bookmarks-editor epiphany 0))
;;
;; When called for the first time on a particular D-Bus object,
;; `dbus-proxy-make-remote-proxy' looks up the set of interfaces
;; implemented by the object and dynamically creates Emacs Lisp code
;; that mimics the D-Bus interfaces. This code mainly consists of
;; functions which correspond to the D-Bus interface methods, but
;; information about D-Bus properties and signals is also stored.
;; When called, the generated functions augment their arguments with
;; D-Bus type information and call their corresponding D-Bus methods.
;; When these proxy components are created, names are transformed from
;; D-Bus-typical CamelCamel to something-more-lispy. The generated
;; functions and object slots can be used like ordinary Emacs Lisp
;; functions and object slots. Generated proxy classes can be
;; inspected using `described-class'.
;;
;; To illustrate the details of the code generation process, let us
;; consider the following introspection data of the
;; /org/gnome/Epiphany object, that has been used in the above
;; example:
;;
;; <!DOCTYPE node PUBLIC "-//freedesktop//DTD D-BUS Object Introspection 1.0//EN"
;; "http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/introspect.dtd">
;; <node>
;;   [...]
;;   <interface name="org.gnome.Epiphany">
;;     <method name="openBookmarksEditor">
;;       <arg name="Timestamp" type="u" direction="in"/>
;;     </method>
;;     [...]
;;   </interface>
;; </node>
;;
;; The method description is translated into the following Emacs Lisp
;; method:
;;
;; (defmethod (this org\.gnome\.Epiphany) Timestamp)
;;   (with-slots (bus service object) this
;;     (dbus-call-method
;;      bus service object "org.gnome.Epiphany" "openBookmarksEditor"
;;      :uint32 Timestamp)))
;;
;; Similar code is generated for the remaining methods, properties and
;; signals of the org.gnome.Epiphany interface and all other
;; interfaces of the D-Bus object.
;;
;; Creating a proxy object works as follows:
;;
;; Input: bus, client, object path
;;
;; 1. Collect all interfaces of the object at the specified path
;; 2. Form class name (1) (which is a symbol) using the sorted
;;    interface names
;; 3. Check whether the symbol has a class value
;; 4.a If there is one, continue with 5.
;; 4.b Create a new class for the object
;;   1. For each interface:
;;     1. Form class name (2) (which is a symbol) using the interface
;;        name
;;     2. Check whether a class exists for the interface
;;     3.a If there is one, continue with next interface
;;     3.b Create a new class
;;       1. Define the new class using the symbol (2)
;;          Parents: `dbus-proxy-interface-object'
;;       2. For each method specified by the interface
;;          1. Transform the method name into a lispy name
;;          2. Create a method definition for the name that calls the
;;             D-Bus method
;;       3. For each property specified by the interface
;;          1. Transform the property name into a lispy name
;;          2. Store a mapping from transformed name to interface name
;;             and property name
;;       4. For each signal specified by the interface
;;          1. Transform the signal name into a lispy name
;;          2. Store a mapping from transformed name to interface name
;;             and signal name
;;   2. Define a (3) class using the symbol (1)
;;      Parents: `dbus-proxy-remote-object' and the classes created in
;;               4.b.1
;; 5. Create an instance of the class from 4.a or (3) for the object
;;    at the specified object path
;;
;; This algorithm is implemented by:
;;
;; + `dbus-proxy-make-remote-proxy'    (1. 2. 5.)
;; + `dbus-proxy-make-interface-class' (4.b.1.)
;; + `dbus-proxy-make-object-class'    (4.b.2.)
;; + `dbus-proxy-make-method-name'     (4.b.1.3.b.2.1)
;; + `dbus-proxy-make-method'          (4.b.1.3.b.2.2)
;; + `dbus-proxy-make-property-name'   (4.b.1.3.b.3.1)
;; + `dbus-proxy-make-signal-name'     (4.b.1.3.b.4.1)
